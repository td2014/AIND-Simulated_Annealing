    "As illustrated in the lectures, simulated annealing is a probablistic technique used for finding an approximate solution to an optimization problem.  In this exercise you will check your understanding by implementing [simulated annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) to solve the [Traveling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) (TSP) between US state capitals.  Briefly, the TSP is an optimization problem that seeks to find the shortest path passing through every city exactly once.  In our example the TSP path is defined to start and end in the same city (so the path is a closed loop).\n",

The choice of representation can have a significant impact on the performance of simulated annealing and other optimization techniques.  Since the TSP deals with a close loop that visits each city in a list once, we will represent each city by a tuple containing the city name and its position specified by an (x,y) location on a grid.  The _state_ will then consist of an ordered sequence (a list) of the cities; the path is defined as the sequence generated by traveling from each city in the list to the next in order."
